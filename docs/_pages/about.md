# About the workshop

We’re spoiled by the cloud. We’re so used to it that when performance problems arise, our very first thought is to scale
our environment. But sometimes the best (or cheapest) option is not to increase system resources — sometimes what we
need to do is dive deeply into the code and do a lot of optimization. You know, like in the old days: Just you and your
profiler (and wicked amounts of caffeine).

In this workshop, we’ll take one of our hiring assignments that focuses on performance. We’ll look at how our candidates
usually solve the task, some of the most common mistakes and misconceptions, and the best optimization strategy.
