## Description

We are going to implement one of our hiring assignments.

The pages are ordered chronologically and during the workshop, you can use them for implementing the assignment.

There are multiple checkpoints. At start of each page, there is a note from which branch you can start in case you
missed something.

During the workshop, there are multiple questions, which I will ask you. There is also an answer in collapsible
section. **Please do not cheat and don't look for the answer before the questions are answered**.

You can continue on the page with
the [assignment](https://uondro.github.io/pycon-2022/assignment/2022-09-09-00-assigment.html). Have fun :)
