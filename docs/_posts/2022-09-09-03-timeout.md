The client of our API can specify timeout. The endpoint should always end in that timeout. If timeout is not specified
we will wait for the first successful response.

## Implementing the timeout functionality

### Get the timeout parameter from the request.

1. Import required packages.

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, jsonify, redirect, url_for, request
    from http import HTTPStatus
    ```

2. Get timeout from request args.

   ```python
    @app.get("/api/smart")
    def smart_api_requester():
        timeout = request.args["timeout"]
        ...
   ```
       
> **_QUESTION:_**  Do you spot any problem?

   - We are missing validation. Let's add it.
       ```python
       def milliseconds_to_seconds(value: int) -> float:
           return value / 1000
       
       
       def get_and_validate_timeout()  -> None | float:
           timeout = request.args.get("timeout")
           if timeout is None:
               return timeout
       
           try:
               converted_timeout = milliseconds_to_seconds(int(timeout))
           except ValueError:
               raise BadRequest("Timeout has to be integer value.")
       
           if converted_timeout <= 0:
               raise BadRequest("Timeout has to be positive non zero value.")
       
           return converted_timeout
       
       
        @app.get("/api/smart")
        def smart_api_requester():
            timeout_seconds = get_and_validate_timeout()
        ```

   - Test timeout arguments.
       - http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/smart?timeout=0
       - http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/smart?timeout=nonumber
       - http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/smart?timeout=10
         The first two request should fail with the bad request status code. The last one should pass.

### End after the timeout is reached.

> **_QUESTION:_** How could we implement this? We need to wait for response and also not check if the timeout is not
reached.

We can use asynchronous features of python. This allows you to write concurrent code.
> **_QUESTION:_** What is the difference between parallelism and concurrency? Is it better to use asynchronous

{% details Click on me for the answer! %}

**Parallelism** consists of performing multiple operations at the same time.

**Concurrency** is a slightly broader term than parallelism. It suggests that multiple tasks have the ability to run
in an overlapping manner. (Thereâ€™s a saying that concurrency does not imply parallelism.)

Threads consume more memory because they need to have their own stack. We also need to secure the thread safety.
Same goes with multiprocessing. Multiprocessing works well if we have multiple CPUs and our processes are
independent - we don't need to provide thread safety.

On the other hand, async is ideal if we have many I/O operations, e.g. waiting for server to respond, multiple writes
into the file and so on.

So, let's create an async program.

1. First we need to install flask with async, so our server can be run asynchronously.
   ```python
   pip install flask[async]==2.2.2
   ```
2. After that, we need to import required packages.
   ```python
   import asyncio
   from aiohttp import ClientSession
   ```
3. Create the async request.
   ```python
   Success: TypeAlias = bool
      
      
   async def fetch() -> tuple[Success, dict]:
       async with ClientSession() as session:
           try:
               async with session.get(BLOOMREACH_SERVER) as response:
                   if response.status == HTTPStatus.OK:
                       try:
                           result_data = await response.json()
                       except ContentTypeError:
                           return False, {}
      
                       return True, result_data
                   else:
                       return False, {}
           except Exception:
               # Catch any session error (e.g. timeout)
               return False, {}
   ```
4. Call async request from our route. 
   ```python
   @app.get("/api/smart")
   async def smart_api_requester():
       timeout_seconds = get_and_validate_timeout()
       try:
           success, result = await asyncio.wait_for(fetch(), timeout=timeout_seconds)
       except asyncio.TimeoutError:
           raise RequestTimeout()
      
       return jsonify(success=success, response=result)
   ```
