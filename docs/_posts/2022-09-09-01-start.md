1. Clone the following repository:

   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/UOndro/pycon-2022.git
   ```

2. Then checkout start branch
   ``python
   git checkout start
   ```

We get very basic skeleton of our application without the real implementation. In our workshop, we will try to finish
the implementation so all the cases in our assignment is covered.

## Setting up the python environment

1. Create python virtual environment
    ```python
    python3.10 -m venv venv
    ```
2. Activate python virtual environment
    ```python
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install requirements
    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

> **_QUESTION:_** Why is good to create and use the virtual environment?

{% details Click on me for the answer! %}

Using the virtual environment allows you to a have different dependencies for each project. This means you to have
different version of python packages. In addition to that you can easily add or remove a package without affecting other
projects.

## Test the application

After successfully setting your environment you, should be able to start your application.

```python
python app.py
```

> **_QUESTION:_**  For running our server we picked web framework Flask. Do you know any python alternatives to Flask?
> Does this alternative have any advantages/disadvantages compared to Flask?

{% details Click on me for the answer! %}

There are many python web frameworks, e.g. FastAPI, Django, Starlette and so on. Each of them have different
advantages/disadvantages, for example Starlette is ideal for async programs. FastAPI also uses Starlette, but also
provide more functionality and so on. I picked flask, because we use it in Bloomreach.
