1. Clone the following repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/UOndro/pycon-2022.git
   ```

2. Then checkout `start` branch
   ``
   git checkout start
   ```

We get a very basic skeleton of our application without the actual implementation. In our workshop, we will try to
finish
the implementation so all the cases in our assignment are covered.

## Setting up the python environment

1. Create python virtual environment
    ```
    python3.10 -m venv venv
    ```
2. Activate python virtual environment
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install requirements
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

> **_QUESTION:_** Why is it good to create and use the virtual environment?

{% details Click on me for the answer! %}

Using the virtual environment allows you to have different dependencies for each project. This means you can have
different version of python packages. In addition to that, you can easily add or remove a packages without affecting
other projects.

## Test the application

After successfully setting your environment, you should be able to start your application.

```python
python
app.py
```

> **_QUESTION:_**  For running our server we picked web framework Flask. Do you know any python alternatives to Flask?
> Does this alternative have any advantages/disadvantages compared to Flask?

{% details Click on me for the answer! %}

There are many python web frameworks, e.g. FastAPI, Django, Starlette, and so on. Each of them has different
advantages/disadvantages, e.g. Starlette is ideal for async programs. FastAPI also uses Starlette, but also
provide more functionality. I picked flask, because we use it in Bloomreach.
