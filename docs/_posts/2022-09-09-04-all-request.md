We were able to trigger the first request and if it has not finished in the specified time, we will raise the
timeout error.

Now, we are going to implement the second and the third request. Those two requests should be triggered 300ms after
the first one. In addition, they should be triggered at once, and we should return the first successful. If the first
request finishes after 300ms, but before the second and third, we will return it.

## Implementing the second and third request

As you might guess, all our requests will be done asynchronously. We need to secure that the second and the third
request is triggered after 300ms after the first one.

&nbsp;1. We are going to postpone the fetch by a specific time.

 ```python
 async def fetch(delay_seconds: float) -> tuple[Success, dict]:
    await asyncio.sleep(delay_seconds)


...
 ```

> **_QUESTION:_** Why did we use `asyncio.sleep` and not traditional time.sleep?

{% details Click on me for the answer! %}
When time.sleep(x) is called, it will block the entire execution of the script, and it will be put on hold, just
frozen, doing nothing. But when you call await asyncio.sleep(x), it will ask the event loop to run something else
while your await statement finishes its execution.
{% enddetails %}

&nbsp;2. Create tasks.

```python
@app.get("/api/smart")
async def smart_api_requester():
    timeout_seconds = get_and_validate_timeout()
    unfinished_tasks = [
        asyncio.create_task(fetch(delay_seconds=0)),
        asyncio.create_task(fetch(delay_seconds=WAIT_BEFORE_NEXT_REQUEST_SECONDS)),
        asyncio.create_task(fetch(delay_seconds=WAIT_BEFORE_NEXT_REQUEST_SECONDS)),
    ]
    ...
```

As we can see, we created 3 tasks. The first request won't be delayed, the second and third one will be delayed for the
time specified in the assignment.

&nbsp;3. Execute those task.

```python
def out_of_time(timeout: None | float) -> bool:
    return timeout is not None and timeout <= 0


@app.get("/api/smart")
async def smart_api_requester():
    timeout_seconds = get_and_validate_timeout()
    unfinished_tasks = [
        asyncio.create_task(fetch(delay_seconds=0)),
        asyncio.create_task(fetch(delay_seconds=WAIT_BEFORE_NEXT_REQUEST_SECONDS)),
        asyncio.create_task(fetch(delay_seconds=WAIT_BEFORE_NEXT_REQUEST_SECONDS)),
    ]
    timeout_remaining = timeout_seconds

    while not out_of_time(timeout_remaining) and unfinished_tasks:
        start = time.monotonic()
        finished_tasks, unfinished_tasks = await asyncio.wait(
            unfinished_tasks, return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED, timeout=timeout_remaining
        )

        for finished_task in finished_tasks:
            success, result = finished_task.result()
            if success:
                return jsonify(success=success, response=result)

        end = time.monotonic()
        timeout_remaining = timeout_remaining - (end - start) if timeout_remaining is not None else timeout_remaining

    if out_of_time(timeout_remaining):
        raise RequestTimeout()

    return jsonify(success=False, response={})
```

We wait for the first task to finish. However, this task could finish with an error or with not successful response.
Therefore, we need to repeat our loop till we don't receive the first successful response, or we are not out of time.

> **_QUESTION:_** There is still one problem in how we handle our tasks, can you spot the problem?

{% details Click on me for the answer! %}

If we got successful response, we will return it, but there might still be two tasks in the event loop.
As we don't need the result from them, we can cancel them.

- Cancel unfinished tasks
   ```python
   ...      
   for unfinished_task in unfinished_tasks:
       unfinished_task.cancel()
          
   if out_of_time(timeout_remaining):
       raise RequestTimeout()
   ...
   ```

{% enddetails %}
